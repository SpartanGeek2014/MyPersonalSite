#This is my Personal Page project

I'll be working on this every chance I get, but it's mostly a side project.
I wanted a format to both put to use and expand the skillset I'm developing
from the lessons learned at Flatiron School as a software/web engineer.

I've added a little bit of JavaScript, to run the photo slider on the photos page, and I may add
 more to handle a login/logout feature.
